Love their red velvet cake and ordered one 24 hours in advance for my birthday. We came it pick it up 20 mins after they were supposed to have it ready, to find out the bakers never got the order. Was told it would be ready in 5 mins by one staff member, so we waited 10. Only then to be told by the actual baker that it would take at least an hour. He was apologetic and said since we couldn't pick up the cake until after my party (since I wasn't going to leave my own birthday party to come back a second time) was told there would be no charge. So one of my guests picked up a second cake at another bakery just so I would have one. When I came back to Lolo's, the cake was ready, and I asked if the $90 I already paid for it when I placed the order the day before was credited as I was told earlier in the day that it would be. After waiting 12 minutes for the manager to check on it, I was told I was wrong, no one told me it would be free, and they'll only credit me $20. After explaining my situation, and that the cake we had to buy to replace the one they didn't have ready in time was almost $50, that I would be fine if they credited me that amount instead of the whole $90. By the time the manager was done arguing with me, I was furious. And after we finally agreed on a 50% discount for dealing with all of their mistakes and misinformation, he even shorted me $5 when he credited back my card! All in all I spent almost an hour in two separate visits on my birthday and ended up having to argue with a senior staff member just to pick up a cake I had ordered a whole day in advance while getting less than half the credit I was promised. \n",

      "First stop from the airport on Thursday. Directly to LoLo's. I saved my appetite from NJ to AZ just for this restaurant!! Boy we were not disappointed!! Carl, the waiter, took excellent care of us. He was helpful, polite, and patient. His choices of food were outstanding!! With so many opportunities to choose from off the menu, we couldn't decide so we ordered a little of everything. Everything was finger licking good! Especially the collard greens, chicken, and home fries. The half and half (tea and lemonade) 2 thumbs up!! \n",

      "Terrible experience. I was encouraged to try this restaurant by several people so I had high expectations that it was going to be a good experience. It was the exact opposite. My wife ordered a chicken sandwich without bacon. They took the sandwich back to the kitchen and tried to fool us by simply taking the bacon off and giving the sandwich back to my wife. So disrespectful and careless. Terrible business practice. I called them out on their dishonesty and they finally made a new sandwich but my wife and children had to wait an additional 20 minutes to be served correctly and they still charged us full price for everything. Needless to say we will never return. Bad business practices. Unprofessional.\n",

      "Traveling with a senior to & fro at times is challenging & this trip out was no exception. My senior Mom misheard & headed straight out to the patio & she seated herself on the patio on a BUSY Saturday at prime time lunch time. This seating is not a seat yourself it's seated by the host staff. However the sweet young man that was the server in the area saw what happened was an innocent mistake on my Mom's part & spoke with the host & they allowed us not only to be seated ahead of another group waiting but let us stay on the patio. What a joy to see someone in their 20's having compassion for someone 60+ years their senior made my day. I was so moved that we didn't have to embarrass & move her I tipped an additional 20% on top of the usual 20% I usually tip. I will never foregut that trip or that young mans kindness. \n",
      "The food oh yeah that's what we're here for right? RIGHT! I have been frequenting Lo-Lo's for years & visited them when they had one location downtown. I'm happy this local fam has made the transition to multiple locations because the fried chicken is beyond perf with crisp moist chickeny goodness & perfectly chewy fluffy waffles. I am a super fan of the sweet & salty combo probably because I am that as well. So I can't vouch any other thing on the menu as I have never left what they're known for. I know shame on me but why mess with the best? Just sayin'. \n",
      "The new Scottsdale location is head & shoulders about the previous in what was a Kyoto Bowl once upon a time & they have a bar & a DJ all day on the weekends. Gotta love that. Well I do so there. Keep it up Lo-Lo's & cheers to many more years of success.\n",

      "The food was great as always, however, Nathan, who was our server was not up to LoLo's standards.  We had a large party for a friends birthday and had called in advance.  We were lectured about how he had to do everything a certain way and was upset when more people came in and took seats.  We were moving down to make room!  I understand that it is hard to work with a big group but we are adults and were socializing, which is why we chose to come here.  When some of us needed to leave and were trying to pay the bills which he knew we were all separate, he told one of the party, \"It isn't going to matter whether I take your payment now or 10 minutes from now.  Okay, I'll put you at the bottom of the list!\"  WHAT!?  I won't stop eating at LoLo's but I won't be back to this one and I won't be recommending it.  At one point, during one of his tirades/lectures, he said, \"Yeah, this has turned into a real sh!t show.\"  He was upset because we were switching seats and talking.  There were about 30 or us.  We would have figured it out when the food came out.  Totally unnecessary!  Extremely disappointed!!\n",

      "Planned to celebrate my birthday here with a large party last Sunday. My wife called them a couple of times during the week leading up to the day of our planned visit. From talking to two different people, she was informed that they would be able to accommodate our party with no issues. We planned on having 40 guests and she was told that they've entertained as many as 60 guests before. They know that we are coming with 40. They know we're coming on a Sunday, for lunch. They don't do reservations but \"as long as we get there about an hour early, it'll be fine.\" So far, so good. \n",
      "\n",
      "Day of, my wife and I get there 45 minutes early (not quite an hour, I know.) We told the hostess our situation and wanted to put our name down for the wait, and they were floored by the amount of people. They began to explain how difficult it would be to accommodate so many people, being that it's their busiest day and at the busiest time. So after waiting for about half and hour, listening to the give us inconsistent information and watching them scramble to make something work for us, we just decide to move the party elsewhere. Before we left, the manager Marcus told us that if we (my wife and I) came back during the week he would \"give us a free meal\". They messed up, but they're trying to make it right. Cool. \n",
      "\n",
      "Last night, we came back for our \"free\" meal. We told the waitress before ordering what Marcus promised us. We didn't hear from Marcus until our bill arrived. Our waitress initially came out saying we can get 30% off. We said that wasn't what we were promised. So then Marcus came out and said that we misunderstood him. He said he would give me, the birthday celebrant, a free meal. So he gave me the option of either getting my entree for free or 30% off the entire bill. Then when we ran the card it ended up being just about 50% after all. Not that we're not appreciative, but it didn't seem like they were going by any kind of policy and was just winging it. With only $15 to pay, he apologized that he couldn't comp the entire thing but somehow was able to offer a free dessert. That kind of confused us. Why have us go through all of this if you can do that? Why not just cover the meal entirely? \n",
      "\n",
      "Basically, they messed up. We gave them a second chance and they somehow made the experience worse. Personally, I can't stand it when people don't stick to their word. For that, they get 1 star.\n",

      "This was my second time here. First experience was not great due to having very dried out chicken and waffles. The other night friends I was with really wanted to go here, so I decided to give it a second chance. I wish we ate at McDonald's instead. On a Saturday night I expect them to be busy but still able to function. For our 6 top we waited about 10 mins to be seated. No biggie. Our server was very nice but had an awesome habit of disappearing for long periods at a time. I'm not sure if they were understaffed or she just disappeared. I asked for a tea-which she forgot about. Someone from our group had to find her to ask for my drink after nothing for 20 or so mins. My food was awful. Eggs swimming in liquid and almost ice cold potatoes (Side note if you are going to charge $4 extra for them please make sure they are hot). What was the worst of this was our table waited around 45 minutes or more for our food. When my friend asked her for my missing drink we were informed it would be another 20 mins for food. There's no excuse for this. A restaurant should be able to push out food and not make people wait an hour for food. We would have left had we of not already been waiting and starving. Absolute waste of money. We got there around 7:30 and didn't leave till after 9PM. For a place that has a lot of recognition this should have been a way better experience.\n",

      "Left Lolo's in Scottsdale at 10:15am. Did not eat there because the service upon entering was terrible. There were two parties waiting at hostess stand but no hostess. There was a young woman cleaning a booth whom I presume was \"the hostess.\"  She turned and saw us but did not acknowledge us. After several minutes another worker brought out a high chair for the baby in one of the waiting parties. Apparently they had to locate it from the back. After several more minutes \"the hostess\"seated the other waiting party in the booth she had just cleaned, although there were several empty booths, without ever asking their table or booth preference. The party asked to be reseated at one of several empty tables and was reseated. The woman finally asked if our party size then turned to do other things. At that point we left, convinced that the rest of the experience would be equally disappointing. There were only about ten to fifteen customers in the restaurant so no reason for the poor customer service.  It seems the business simply does not care about basic customer service. Not sure whether the food is good or not and we'll never know because we will not return. We promptly went to a competitor's restaurant where we were promptly greeted, waited only about ten minutes for a table despite their full house had a very enjoyable meal.  Lolo's owner should invest some resources in training his staff in customer service 101.\n",

      "First time here.  I was motivated to try this place because Yelp sent some email about waffles.  On the list was Lo-Lo's.  Well, you know how that goes.  It gets into your head and you gotta try it.  Saturday is my non-cooking day, but it wasn't the smartest thing to show up at Lo Lo's on a Saturday night.  Yikes,  the line was out the door, into their patio, into the parking lot and up the street (just kidding about the street)  Went to check in to give my name and number in the party but had to wait because too many people were fussing about the wait and who got there first, etc.  Luckily the owner (I think; lady with short red hair) was a strong yet polite lady and explained that the 50-60 minute wait was what it was.  If it was shorter, good, but she couldn't guarantee that.  People don't like to hear the truth.  I was prepared to face up to my stupidity of coming on a Saturday night when there is Monday, Tuesday, Wednesday, Thursday, Friday and Sunday.  So I KNEW I was waiting and I would be waiting until people finished smacking their lips on that delish fried chicken and everything else.  But No.  People gotta fuss.  Speaking of fussing, a woman slid in front of me and when the check-in lady looked at both of us to figure out who was there first, the woman said to me,  \"I was waiting here didn't you see me?\".  My answer was \"No, I didn't.  But you go on ahead because I am not starting a scene here over a table\".  I think the owner overheard me and smiled.  Did I tell you the woman was bigger than I am?  I am no stupid chick from the Bronx.  You don't fight unless you have to and it won't be over a table.  So about 20 minutes later the owner, shall I call her Redhead, for short? motioned us over and led us to a table for four.  Nice table, I thought and not so long a wait.  She picks up the menus from the table and says, come with me, I have a better seat for you--I like you guys.  And then she led me to the almighty BOOTH.  I love Booths. I love Booths, Did I tell you I love booths?  OMG. A booth.  Thank you lord. Thank you Ms. Redhead.  I knew that stepping back and not body slamming that aggressive woman at the beginning would pay off. Did I tell you she was bigger than I am?  Did I tell you we don't fight in the Bronx unless it's for big stakes.  Yes, I believe I did.  \n",

She said, Sorry it took so long, but we had to wait until the glasses were washed.  Wow.  I realize it is a packed house but at moments like these when you run out of glasses what's wrong with serving water out of a red party cup?  I wouldn't have minded especially with the generous slice of lemon they put in it.  Think about it.  I understand beer and cocktails being served in glass (BTW, they are large mason jars I forgot to tell you), but not water.  You can slide on water.\n",
      "Hubby ordered the chicken salad with a side of french fries.  I went on full mode pig out.  2 fried chicken thighs with a waffle AND a side of mac and cheese.  \n",
      "Hubby's order came out with the bacon he did NOT want.  Know anybody else who doesn't eat bacon?  I don't. Just him.  When corrected, the salad had mixed greens, half a sliced avocado and nice chunks of fried chicken.  The fries were fresh with a sprinkling of some delicious topping.  He was happy.  My thighs were not greasy (the chicken's, that is). The waffle, while thin, had a lot of flavor (maybe vanilla and cinnamon).  The mac and cheese was tasty and creamy.  What it was lacking was the crunchiness on the top and the corners.  I like the mac n cheese to have crunch on top.  This was smooth like \"Stouffers\".  Not saying it's Stouffers, just texture wise. \n",
      "\n",
      "I totally enjoyed my gorge-fest. I finished everything on the plate.  Hubby on the other hand said that while the salad was fresh, varied and plentiful his chicken salad was not worth a repeat visit.  As always, he said he could stay home and get better food.  Yes, ladies.  That is the punishment for learning to cook and cook well.  Men are like breast fed babies when it comes to home cooked meals.  They want breast milk and will reject formulas or substitutes that are just as good.  So let's ignore hubby's assessment and trust me that the food was very good and worth a repeat visit.  Thank you Ms. Redhead for the booth and the great food.\n",

      "This is probably my worst and longest review ever so be ready Chicken Waffle fans!! We woke up in the morning after a long night of alcoholic beverages and decided to go to get Chicken and Waffles because what's better than that when you only got alcohol in your system??!! I had family in town and they were very excited to eat at this place because it has a good reputation. We got there at about 12:15 they have \"free\" valet but technically you're going to have to slide the guy some change so it's not \"free\" anymore. We had a party of 8 so they lady said 45 minutes (we should of left because this is where everything bad comes). The clocked had hit 1:30 and we were still outside and everyone else was moving right in.. A party of 6 went in and a couple more went in before us and we still haven't got anything so I ask the lady what's going on it went from 45 minutes to more than a hour she replied with soon and a couple of giggles I think she thought I was joking or something. After she called us in and we sat down and our waiter said the food is going to take about a hour to come out??... I didn't understand this part I actually was very confused because we waited in line for over an hour than we have to wait another hour? Why couldn't they tell us that before we waited the hour? Why couldn't the lady go \"hey you're gonna have  about a two hour wait time with waiting for a table and food do you want to place your order now so it would be ready by the time you got a table?\" At this point we just waited it out we ordered our Foods and yes it did take an hour but what got me really mad was they brought our appetizers out like 3 minutes before brining out our food wouldn't it be smart to push this first early because of such a long wait time.. Our food came out but all in different times half the table had their food and half didn't for about 10 minutes.. With respect the people on the table waited for us to have our food also but it didn't come out so I asked for the manager and asked her how half the food can come out and the other half isn't out yet and how we waited so long and nobody told us we would have to wait over 2 hours to eat at this pathetic place. The managers response didn't have sorry or what can I do to help or something like that it was a very ignorant pathetic response I was actually very disappointed because it was the manager.. She said would you guys like dessert when my food wasn't even out yet? When would the dessert come the next day?.. The manager sucks the staff sucks the service is terrible. This place needs a makeover. I didn't even eat my food because I waited so long I lost my appetite and I was very angry. I paid the tab and left no tip and I have never done that in my life because I am a business owner and I would hate to see that but I felt like I had he right.\n",

      "However, the first time I tried Lo-Lo's, my mind was fuckin' blown away. They literally blow Roscoe's out of the water. I have NEVER had a bad experience with the service or the food at Lo-Lo's and if I could, I would eat that shit EVERY fuckin day! The chicken is so juicy and so tender while the outside is crispy and not flaky or drowning in oil like at so many other fried chicken joints. Their mac-n-cheese was also mouth watering with the globs of cheese they cover it in and their biscuits that were drowning is sausage gravy are as soft and fluffy as Charmin. \n",

If it's a hot summer day and you're thirsty as fuck then this shit will quench your thirst like it's the first time you've ever had liquid in your body.

      "Super disappointed.  I love this place and I love soul food.  Been here many times.  However today was a real let down.  It was later in the day about 1:00pm on a Saturday.  Initially the restaurant was busy but not more then our previous trips.  We were told it would be a 25 minute wait to be seated for our party of six.  At about 35 minutes we asked how much longer and she said she was getting a table ready and even pointed to it.  She gave it away abut 15 minutes later.  We asked again.  Same thing.  At this point the restaurant was at about 50% capacity.  We got a table after reminding her again for a third time and then got our waitress who seemed to be on the same slow regimen as the hostess.  We put in our order.  Time slipped by and we told our waitress we were concerned.  The \"chef\" came out and I told him we were dissatisfied and he argued with me that the order had been put in 37 minutes earlier and they had a large party outside.  I told him we had been there for 90 minutes total in the restaurant and he was less then sympathetic.  In fact I felt he was quite put out by us.\n",
      "Now I cook waffles at home and I'm sure the collard greens are made in large quantities before hand so I'm not sure even 37 minutes is necessary to get the food to the table and I believe the whole experience was a series of small errors in the flow from the hostess to the waitress to the kitchen but to deny there was an issue and blame it on us degraded the experience to the point where we cancelled our order and left hungry.\n",

We did order drinks and green fried tomatoes along with fried chicken gizzards .The beverages were delivered pronto but the appetizers were just a memory,  they finally arrived and the server apologized and told us she added some fried green beans because of the long wait. We got a million green beans but only four tomato slices, lot of gizzards too.\n",
      "I had to ask our server for plates and that's all we got, no eating utensils or napkins , I assume she thought it was finger licking good, it wasn't,  every thing was luke warm and tasteless. \n",

      "I've been to Lo-Lo's couple of times now and I really don't understand the big fuss is about.  I think the food here is very average.  The chicken is ok, I personally think Popeyes Chicken is better and the waffles are plain waffles, something that you can get in any breakfast place.  The catfish was decent, but nothing to rave about.  One thing I will say is the sides are really good.  The mac and cheese and collard greens were flavorful and delicious, only drawback is, its served in a very small bowl, so you don't get much besides couple of bites.  The corn bread was good, but how could it not be, there was about a 1/4 lb of butter sitting on top of it.\n",
      "\n",
      "One thing that did irk me was, I felt like they wanted us out of there as soon as possible.  It was a little busy and I understand they want to turn tables, but we got our check literally a minute after we got our food.  I noticed the waiter would walk by and look at the check, and hope we were ready to pay, but since we weren't even finished with our meal, I refused to give them my debit card.  I had to ask several times to get my drink refilled and the 2nd time I asked for a refill, they put it in a go to cup for me as if they were ready for me to take it to go.  It's seriously uncalled for.\n",

      "Let's start with the good, the food. We had fried green tomatoes to start and some variation of chicken and waffles (some liked breasts some liked darker pieces) and all were delicious. The seasoning on the chicken is just fantastic and the waffles are thin tasty treats that really go well with the chicken. I have no complaints with the food at all. \n",

After being sat we waited for about 10 min before anyone came to the table. One waitress came out to help 2 tables near us, looked at us and walked inside. She didn't even acknowledge that we were waiting. Finally a waiter came over and said he drew the short straw and was going to wait in us, when clearly he had a full set of tables inside. We ordered all food and drinks while he was there and he put them all in at the same time stating he wanted to make sure we got our food on time. So, all apps and entrees came out together. \n",

I was so disappointed in our experience and I wasn't the only one.  It was very busy the day we went- Oct 31st, 2014 - However, it looked as if the restaurant had not planned for that.  There were not enough staff on and the staff they had looked confused.  We sat at the bar and did not get noticed for about 20 minutes.  We had to ask for menus.  There were people around us complaining about how long it took to get their food.  The staff seemed as if they did not care.  There was only one bartender and she seemed to be in her own world.  We waited almost 45 minutes for our food.  I asked for a refill on coffee and that took another 25 minutes and I had to ask twice.  The kicker was they did not give me a new cup and she poured old coffee and when she realized it was bad she said she would get me new - however put the same old cup back.  When the new coffee came another person took my old cup and poured coffee into it... \n",

And a couple times when it's been busy the servers get shuffled around a bunch so we might need to give our order twice and one time they forgot an extra waffle my boyfriend ordered, though it was quickly fixed.

I have been living out of the country since summer 2011, & was excited to see the new bigger location in Old Town.\n",

      "I decided to go in for a meal today, & the food was still good, but not as good as I remembered. The real disappointment was the service. I wasn't acknowledged when I walked in. I looked around, & decided to eat at the bar. There was an older guy behind the bar. He didn't even say hi, until someone else told him I was there. Then he started to take my order, walked off with no explanation, then came back to say they were out of it earlier, but they had it now. Ok great. I was ready to finish my order, but he walked off & greeted other customers & started telling them about happy hour. I was shocked. I reminded him that I hadn't finished ordering, & so he came back. I can honestly say I have never had an ordering situation like this before in my life. Then he never came back. Someone else ran my food out, & he seemed to be leaving for the day.\n",
      "\n",
      "I totally get that it must have been the end of his shift, but he could have at least checked on my food & told me he was moving my tab over. He still hung out for a bit to chat with other employees, so it's not like he was rushing out. The lady who took over, was nice & gave decent service.\n",
      "\n",
      "My bill came to just under $30 for a lemonade, one happy hour cocktail, & a chicken meal. Frankly I could get the same meal elsewhere with better service for less. It's sad to see that Lo-Lo's has become this.\n",

      "Planned to celebrate my birthday here with a large party last Sunday. My wife called them a couple of times during the week leading up to the day of our planned visit. From talking to two different people, she was informed that they would be able to accommodate our party with no issues. We planned on having 40 guests and she was told that they've entertained as many as 60 guests before. They know that we are coming with 40. They know we're coming on a Sunday, for lunch. They don't do reservations but \"as long as we get there about an hour early, it'll be fine.\" So far, so good. \n",
      "\n",
      "Day of, my wife and I get there 45 minutes early (not quite an hour, I know.) We told the hostess our situation and wanted to put our name down for the wait, and they were floored by the amount of people. They began to explain how difficult it would be to accommodate so many people, being that it's their busiest day and at the busiest time. So after waiting for about half and hour, listening to the give us inconsistent information and watching them scramble to make something work for us, we just decide to move the party elsewhere. Before we left, the manager Marcus told us that if we (my wife and I) came back during the week he would \"give us a free meal\". They messed up, but they're trying to make it right. Cool. \n",
      "\n",
      "Last night, we came back for our \"free\" meal. We told the waitress before ordering what Marcus promised us. We didn't hear from Marcus until our bill arrived. Our waitress initially came out saying we can get 30% off. We said that wasn't what we were promised. So then Marcus came out and said that we misunderstood him. He said he would give me, the birthday celebrant, a free meal. So he gave me the option of either getting my entree for free or 30% off the entire bill. Then when we ran the card it ended up being just about 50% after all. Not that we're not appreciative, but it didn't seem like they were going by any kind of policy and was just winging it. With only $15 to pay, he apologized that he couldn't comp the entire thing but somehow was able to offer a free dessert. That kind of confused us. Why have us go through all of this if you can do that? Why not just cover the meal entirely? \n",
      "\n",
      "Basically, they messed up. We gave them a second chance and they somehow made the experience worse. Personally, I can't stand it when people don't stick to their word. For that, they get 1 star.\n",

Finally, he graced me with his presence before heading into the kitchen to investigate.  He returned with the following line \"according to your ticket time, sir, you have only been waiting for thirty one minutes.\"  When we questioned if it was possible the waitress forgot to enter the order in right away he repeated the line like a robot and closed with \"that's what I have to go on.\" I was ready to leave when another member of my party took over the conversation and was invited by the manager to go look at the ticket time in the kitchen.    \n",

I have never witnessed anything like this in a restaurant... Wait--one time at a car dealership that I also vowed never to give my business to again. An employee gave notice and was saying good-bye to her coworkers, very subtly. He came and asked her to leave or he would call the police--seriously??  In front of people eating dinner. He came out a second time and asked her if she would leave on her own or he had to bring the police. I would not have known she had given notice had he not made a fuss. It was that subtle. Seems like overkill and extremely unprofessional to humiliate her in front of patrons. I can't say I blame her if this is how he treats employees. I even spoke on her behalf and he was rude to me--a paying customer. Of course he never apologized and went back into his cave. Get rid of this manager.\n",
